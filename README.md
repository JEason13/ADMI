# ADMI
Active Directory Management Interface (ADMI) for user and endpoint device management on an Active directory (AD) system.

# Introduction
The Active Directory Management Interface (ADMI) program is a tool with the aim of making Microsoft Active Directory (AD) and PowerShell easier to use for beginers. Full Disclaimer! - This is my high school senior capstone projet and may not be structured the best. 

The system would create a Graphical user interface (GUI) based platform on which the user can manage a wide array of devices and issue commands to them. In addition, the Active Directory Management Interface (A.D.M.I.) would assist the user's ability to administrate their users and perform actions quickly. 

A.D.M.I. will increase its system's response time and ease of use.

# Goals and Timelines 
To create the A.D.M.I. program The following goals will be achieved within the specified timeframe; meeting the predefined milestones: 
**Goals**: 

_Goal one:_ Create a GUI using a PowerShell system that can run without issues on a host computer.

Timeline: First 4 weeks of the project.
    
_Goal two:_ Configure the batch system to interface with Microsoft AD. 

Timeline: Next 4 weeks of the project.
    
_Goal three:_ Testing and fine-tuning the program. 

Timeline: The final 4 weeks of the project.
